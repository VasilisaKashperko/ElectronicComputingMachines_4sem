DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY: The software and documentation provided by FinalWire Ltd. is provided without warranty. FinalWire gives no guarantee that the Software is free from defects. The risk therefore lies on you to use the product with the knowledge that the performance and quality of the software may not be optimal.

In any case, FinalWire and its suppliers’ and licensors’ entire liability under any provision of this agreement shall not exceed in the total sum of the fees you have paid for this license (if any), with the exception of death or personal injury caused by the negligence of FinalWire to the extent to which applicable law prohibits the limitation of damages in such cases. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not be applicable.
